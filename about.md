# Our Research Focus

The Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Laboratory (MPCR) at Florida Atlantic University has become a nucleus for cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence (AI). Housed within the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, our breadth of research encompasses a multitude of AI facets, drawing from diverse academic disciplines.

From the outset, our primary goal has been to unravel the mysteries of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Through rigorous study, we have advanced algorithms and explored the synergies between AI and robotics.

Our partnership with the Center for Future Mind amplifies our exploration into how AI intersects with cognitive sciences, delving into the evolving landscape of cognition.

Beyond applications, we are laying the groundwork for AI's core principles. A significant emphasis is on cryptographic computing, ensuring AI systems, especially in critical domains like medicine, are built on a foundation of safety. This rigorous approach aims to produce AI tools that are not just transformative but also trustworthy.

Our research teams have been diligently advancing specialized areas within AI. One group has been making headway in secure biometrics, working on solutions that prioritize privacy, which is especially pertinent for applications in medicine and science. Another is delving into the foundational principles of digital physics. Furthermore, we're pioneering Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) techniques for secure medical data processing, ensuring patient information remains confidential even during computational tasks. Simultaneously, our exploration into hyperdimensional computing seeks to develop AI systems that are not only efficient but also robust and resilient to various challenges.

A testament to our lab's impact is the success of our members. They have secured placements at prestigious institutions: MIT, Yale, Harvard Law, Stanford, Caltech, Brown Medical, the University of Florida, and Georgia Tech. Additionally, some have moved on to esteemed Federal Research labs, with members joining the Department of Homeland Security and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Our commitment to AI safety was underscored during our presentation to the Intelligence Community (IC) in Washington DC. This engagement emphasized the global relevance of our research, championing the cause for AI that melds innovation with integrity.

With a trajectory steeped in innovation, MPCR remains poised to spearhead breakthroughs in AI research, merging excellence with ethical responsibility.
