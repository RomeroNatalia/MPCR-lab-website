# Project Description
The One Instruction Set Computer (OISC) project is an innovative endeavor to reimagine the foundational structures of computing. At its core, the OISC is a new type of machine language designed to be layered over existing hardware. This unique approach simplifies the building process, allowing individuals to craft and understand systems from the ground up.
