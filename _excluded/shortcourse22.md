# What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence where we give the computer the ability to learn, rather than tell it what to learn.  

Here at MPCR, we look at Deep Learning as a member of multiple fields, if not every field. AI has its roots in Psychology and Biology, and we strive to remain true to those origins when we consider Deep Learning as a Theory of the Brain. However, it is also highly computational and is an important tool for today’s Data Scientists. Deep Learning has already begun to answer questions in fields such as Medicine, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering, and it is gaining momentum. Understanding and contributing to the Deep Learning Movement in AI will have an impact both on the researcher, as well as society on the whole.

# What can Deep Learning do?

Deep learning can do almost everything! We are putting these artificial brains to work for
* diagnosing cancer,
* finding potential new drugs to treat HIV,
* learning how to smell, and
* driving autonomously.  

These projects come from different fields, but converge on their approach: Deep Learning.  

MPCR is equipped with a numerous Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that run various types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on our data.  

**With these resources, we firmly believe that Deep Learning will revolutionize many fields of science and engineering, allowing for new ways of analyzing data and generating new questions and methodologies. In this short course, we strive to provide participants with the skills to bring Deep Learning to their unique and diverse problems from any field.**

## What will be covered in this Short Course?

The goal of this course is to take someone with minimal or no prior experience in Deep Learning and give them both the conceptual framework to understand the algorithms, as well as the computational practice to be able to begin to deploy them in their home research settings.


Participants will gain hands-on experience of topics using Python via Colaboratory on Google Drive. They will also be introduced to some of the applied research projects currently taking place in the lab to see how Deep Learning can be applied to a wide range of problems. Students do not need any previous experience with Python or computer programming but will need to bring their own laptop computers to access the scripts online.


# Our short course offers all of the following:

* History of and Inspiration for Deep Learning
* Key Topics for Understanding Deep Learning e.g.
  * Types of Deep Neural Netwoks
    * Perceptrons
    * Convolutional Neural Networks
    * Generative-Adversarial Networks
    * etc.
* Hands-On Practice with Real World Applications

# Affiliations and Support
**The MPCR's Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Boot Camp is available in part because of the support provided by the
[Charles E. Schmidt College of Science at Florida Atlantic University][2].**
