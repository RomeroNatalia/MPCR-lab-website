## Transfer Credits
Any transfer credits toward requirements for the Ph.D. degree program must be approved by the program faculty as well as by the University. A maximum of 30 credits may be transferred.

## Admission to Candidacy
Admission to doctoral candidacy depends on the student's successful completion of the core coursework, successful completion of the qualifying research paper, satisfactory annual reviews of the student's progress by program faculty and selection of a program faculty member who is willing to chair the student's doctoral dissertation.

## Dissertation - 12 credits
Dissertation (ISC 7980) taken over multiple terms.  

**A central requirement for the Ph.D. degree program is submission and defense of a dissertation based on original work in an area of specialization acceptable to the student's doctoral committee. Approval of a dissertation proposal by the doctoral committee must precede the experimental and/or theoretical work required.**

## Minimum Degree Total - 80 credits

# Plan of Study
All Center Ph.D. students must have a **Plan of Study (POS)** on file with the Graduate College. The plan of study outlines all coursework requirements for the Ph.D. program. It is approved by one's advisor(s), faculty of the center, the director of the center, and the Graduate College.
