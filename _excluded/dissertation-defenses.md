* **Title: Functional Brain Connectivity Associated with Repetitive Behavior in Autism Spectrum Disorder**
* Abstract:
  * The high prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) results in a large cost to individuals, their families, and society at large. Within individuals with ASD, those demonstrating a higher degree of repetitive behaviors are more likely to exhibit specific impairments in cognitive function that affect quality of life. Resting state functional connectivity has increasingly been utilized to characterize alterations in brain connectivity associated with disease states. Typically, networks are identified either via numerical techniques such as independent component analysis, or computing connectivity from o priori "seeds." The current study used a whole brain analysis to identify patterns of functional connectivity at rest that identify individuals with a high degree of repetitive behavior in subjects with autism spectrum disorder using functionally and anatomically defined regions of interest within the cerebrum to generate hypotheses further tested by seed-based approaches. Modeling confirms both this approach and use ofo priori seeds identified connections significantly associated with repetitive behavior. Furthermore, networks identified demonstrate overlap with those identified as abnormal in other disease states associated with repetitive behaviors. The functional and anatomical significance of the putative network identified is assessed.

## Darwin Romulus - June 11th, 2021
* **Title: The Assessment of the Role of Microsaccadic Eye Movements in Bistable Motion Perception**
* Abstract:
  * Even during fixation, the eye is rarely still, as miniature eye movements continue to :1ch within fixational periods of the eye. These miniature movements are referred to as ﬁxational eye movements. W are one of the three types of fixational eye movements that have been identiﬁed. Empirical explorations of W and their role in vision date back to the earlier periods of the 20th century; their function have been attributed to different visual processes phenomena such as fixation stability, perceptual fading, and Wig, perception. Still, debates surrounding the functional role of W in vision ensued, as many of the fundings i'om earlier W reports contradict one another and the polarity in the ﬁeld caused by these debates led many to believe that W do not hold a necessary f specialized role in vision. To gain a deeper understanding of W and its relevance in vision, we sought out to assess the role of mm in bistable motion perception in our behavioral-tracking study. Observers participated in an eye-tracking experiment where they were asked to complete a motion discrimination ask while viewing a bistable apparent motion stimuli. The collected eye-tracking data was then used to train a classiﬁcation model to predict directions of illusory motion perceived by observers. We found that small changes n1 gaze position during fixation, occurring within or outside W:,vents predicted the direction of motion pattern imposed by the motion stimuli. Our ﬁndings suggest that W and fixational eye movements are correlated with motion perception and that miniature eye movements occurring during ﬁxation may have relevance n1 vision.
