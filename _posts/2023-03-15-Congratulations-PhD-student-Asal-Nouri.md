<blockquote>
Congratulations to the awardees of the inaugural Jumpstart Postdoctoral Program. I am pleased to announced that five research projects, out of 22 applications, were awarded funding to support a postdoctoral scholar to “jumpstart” new multi-disciplinary research collaborations between faculty and postdoctoral associates. <br>
<br>
The first cohort of this program represents scientific studies across the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, and includes participation from the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and the Schmidt College of Medicine. <br>
