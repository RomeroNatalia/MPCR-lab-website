Congratulations to Dr. Paul Morris for successfully defending his dissertation, "*Computation in Self-Attention Networks*".

Paul Morris joined the MPCR Lab early after it started when he saw William Hahn and Michael Teti at the FAU stadium showing off their rover project. Since then, Paul worked on a variety of projects from high throughput drug screening to pose machines and nonlinear dynamics of large language models (LLMs).
