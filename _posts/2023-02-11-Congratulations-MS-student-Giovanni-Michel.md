Congratulations to [Giovanni Michel][Gio], a student member of the MPCR lab and the [Center for the Future Mind][cfm]. Giovanni was just admitted to Northwestern University's Ph.D. program in Engineering, with a specialization in electrical engineering relating to his work in the Sandbox. 

We will miss you, Giovanni, but this is such an exciting move! We look forward to hearing about your work when you visit during the summers!
