# Research Description
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in May 2016, and have been a researcher in the [**Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotic Lab (MPCR)**](https://mpcrlab.com) since November 2015. I work with Drs. Elan Barenholtz and William Hahn using deep learning to help solve problems in computational biology.  

I believe that neural-inspired machine learning techniques are increasingly capable of modeling biological interactions. My goal as a Ph.D. student is to design computer models which can both be used as predictive tools, and reverse-engineered to further our understanding of biology. With the MPCR lab, I designed and implemented a highly accurate, interpretable deep learning tool for early lung, brain, and kidney cancer detection using targeted RNA-Seq data which can be analyzed to find new biomarkers for cancer. I am currently interested in developing algorithms to understand protein folding and molecular interaction in order to assist in designer molecule creation.
