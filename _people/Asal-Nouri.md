# About
Asal Nouri is a doctoral student in Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, and a member of FAU's the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences as well as FAU’s Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute's Graduate Neuroscience Training Program (GNTP). Nouri earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Texas at Arlington before moving to South Florida.

# Research Description
Asal Nouri is interested in using non-invasive brain imaging to understand the neural mechanisms involved in attention, and working memory in human subjects and compare them to those of artificial intelligence agents.  More specifically, studying how representations from sensory areas are prioritized, and utilized at higher level cortical areas to produce efficient memory-guided motor behavior.


# Research Interests
* EEG
* Working Memory
* Attention
* Machine Learning

# Went To
Dr. Nouri joined the [Social Neuroscience Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/forbessocialneurolab/) as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Florida Atlantic University's Department of Psychology.
