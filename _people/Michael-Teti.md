# Biography
Michael Teti is a Ph.D. student at Florida Atlantic University in the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences. He has been studying and working with deep neural networks and neuro-inspired learning algorithms since 2013, most recently at [**Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)**](https://lanl.gov/) and previously at the [**Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience**](https://mpfi.org/) while pursuing his doctoral degree. His dissertation research, which he is in the early stages of proposing, involves using state-of-the-art deep learning models to help understand neuronal networks and mechanisms, while conversely using insights from human perception to help improve deep learning models.
