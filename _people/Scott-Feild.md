# Education
* M.B.A., Washington University St. Louis
* B.A., Economics

# Biography
I earned my MBA at Washington University in St. Louis after earning my BA in Economics while working in a General Motors factory in numerous capacities, beginning on the assembly line. As a production manager, I managed as many as 55 direct reports. Among many positions, I was a training facilitator, in which I led training programs integrating participative management with salary and hourly employees. 


I built and run a management consulting practice focused on business strategy, planning, competitive analysis, financial analysis and projections, business plan documentation, preparation, and presentation to strategic partners and funding sources. I guide CXOs and management teams in vision alignment and planning sessions and projects. 


As a leader in the real estate community in South Florida, I have served as President of the Realtors Commercial Alliance and serve on multiple boards. I have routinely led board meetings, sessions, and symposiums with 50 to over 150 participants. 


I have invested hundreds of hours as a volunteer and evangelist for an Artificial Intelligence lab at Florida Atlantic University, where I have enjoyed a broad strategic overview of many compelling applications of the technology. I served as the Chair of the Dean's Advisory Committee for the College of Science.  


I have taught classes in entrepreneurial business and marketing as an adjunct professor at Lynn University. 


As a key accounts manager for a corporate travel firm, I improved operations and dramatically reduced trouble calls with Fortune 1000 clients. 


Through all of these experiences and more, I have developed skills for communicating effectively at the CXO and corporate board level as well as on the factory floor and at the kitchen table, in personal selling, training, leading groups, influencing without formal authority, research and analysis, and explaining complex information in an understandable and approachable manner.
