# Research Description
Rachel has been studying artificial intelligence research since 2017. Her work has focused on computer vision, natural language processing, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, complex systems, and agent-based modeling. Her current research is focused on emergent cognitive phenomena in simulated computational environments. Her main goal is to work on architectures that produce generally intelligent agents.
