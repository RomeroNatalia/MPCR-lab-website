# Biography
I have a B.S. in Mathematics with a Statistics Minor and a B.A. and M.A. in Philosophy with a focus on Philosophy of Mind.  

I believe that Neural Networks and Machine Learning can make valuable improvements to a wide variety of real-world tasks, and can help with a variety of academic and scientific research problems.  In my Doctoral research, I would like to implement Neural Networks to mimic human and animal behavior and thereby glean insights into various questions of human cognition and Philosophy of Mind.  I am interested in the intersection of machine vision (powered by neural networks), and optical illusions.
