# Project Description
This Ph.D. dissertation is intended to test a novel way to absorb the personality of users of large language models (LLM's).  Dramatis persona is a construct in creative writing which emobodies a character's personality in just a few sentences and can carry that character through dramatic arcs in multiple created or LLM-generated stories.  This project will attempt to extract a dramatis persona of a user based on the user's dialog and personal descriptions.  That dramatis persona will then be used to synthesize a matching (or mirrored) personality of the LLM.  The method will be compared to other approaches to personality mirroring, including Big Five.
