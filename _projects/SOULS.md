# Project Description
Ensoul is a framework proposed for the purpose of creating technologies that create more technologies through the combined use of networks of energy homeostatic (enerstatic) loops and open-ended evolutionary techniques. Generative technologies developed by such an approach serve both as simple, yet insightful models of thermodynamically driven complex systems, and as powerful sources of novel technologies. “Self Organizing intelligent Ultra Low power Systems” (SOULS) is a term that well describes the technologies produced by such a generative technology, as well as the generative technology itself. It is meant to capture the abstract nature of such technologies as being independent of the substrate that they are embedded in. In other words, SOULS can be biological, artificial or hybrid in form.
